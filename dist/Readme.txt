Windows packaging stuff
=======================

To create an installer, you need nsis (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) and Python.

Just run the accompanying makeinstaller.py script, giving it the path to a clean StuntRally prefix as a command line argument. The installer will be created to the current working directory.

Designed for Linux, but should work on Windows too.
